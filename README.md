# ChatClear+

ChatClear+ is a simple Fabric mod designed to enhance the way servers clear chat messages, improving the normal method of flooding the chat with empty newlines.

Instead of seeing a bunch of newlines randomly and taking up some of the screen, you can directly ignore the newlines and clear when a certain amount of newlines have been met.

This is a 100% client side mod, so you don't need to be the server owner in order to install this.

## Settings:
- **Messages To Trigger Clear**: (can be 25 - 1000) The amount of newlines to trigger the proper chat clear
- **Allow Empty Messages**: (disabled by default) Allows seeing empty newlines in chat, which can make the chat window take a big amount of the screen
- **Custom Clear Message**: The message to show when the chat has been cleared
